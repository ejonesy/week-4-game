# week-4-game

This is a fun game I created where the user is given a total and a series of buttons with secret values. The user has to click the buttons to try and add up to the given total. Once the user has won or lost, they reset the game and the buttons get brand new values. Better put on some sunglasses, because this game has serious sparkle!
